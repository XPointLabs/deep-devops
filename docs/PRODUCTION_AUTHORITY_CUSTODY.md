# Production authority custody

Until explicitly changed by the owner, all production authority roles are
operated by **Mr. X**. The operator boundary is temporary; cryptographic roles
remain separate so a later multi-operator ceremony does not require reusing one
key across protocols.

Provision once into the protected workspace secret root:

```powershell
node .\scripts\production-authority-provision.mjs `
  --out-dir C:\Work\DeepSession\secrets\prod\authority
```

The operation fails on a non-empty target and stages the complete set before an
atomic directory rename. Private files are raw 32-byte Ed25519 seeds or raw
32-byte integrity keys. Public keys, role IDs, custody-domain hashes, thresholds,
and the generated production network ID are recorded in
`public/custody-manifest.v1.json`.

The `offline-root-1` private seed is local-only and must never be copied to a
registry or node host. Registry DTT signers use a logical 2-of-3 policy even
while one person holds all three custody boundaries. MSG evidence, Contact/XPK,
and Group GSR1/DCR1 each have a distinct key. Release signing credentials remain
separate from protocol authorities.
